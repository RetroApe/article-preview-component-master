## My process

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. 3 days of suffering; AKA "learning JavaScript"

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript for the first time
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I know there is a simple way to do this just with CSS and I would have done it that way, but this was supposed to be done with JavaScript because "practice".

How much time I took to make this work is many times more than how much it would have taken if I have just done it using CSS. 

That being said, I have learned a lot and I found a lot of satisfaction making this work in the end.
